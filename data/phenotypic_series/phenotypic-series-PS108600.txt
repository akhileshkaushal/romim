Phenotype Mapping Key
1 - the disorder is placed on the map due to its association with a gene, but the underlying defect is not known.
2 - the disorder was placed on the map by statistical methods.
3 - the molecular basis of the disorder is known.
4 - a contiguous gene duplication or deletion syndrome in which multiple genes are involved.
